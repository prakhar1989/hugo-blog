> At Facebook, I described myself as "the engineer who hates PHP the least" and have also been called a "PHP idiot savant". While I'm not really a fan of PHP, my understanding of it is extremely deep so there's a huge activation energy for me to learn something else. I also think language choice is far less important than most people make it out to be; in my experience, the people who I have encountered who scoff the hardest at PHP and cry the most loudly about the importance of languages tend to also be really bad at doing any useful work in the languages they advocate.  - Evan Priestly
