I spent this weekend building a cool visualization to better understand Monte Carlo methods. With [p5.js]() just being released last week, I was anxiously looking for a project idea that I could use this library for. Thanks to a [Functional Programming](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/courses/cos326-12/) course that I was working on last week, the idea came soon enough.

Monti Pi is a simple app that shows how you can carry out multiple Monte Carlo simulations to approximate the value of Pi. You can go ahead and check out the [demo on Heroku](http://montepie.herokuapp.com). Both p5 and coffeescript have been a total joy to use so much so that the next time I work on a Javascript project, I'll make sure I use Coffeescript!

Much to my surprise, the project came on the front-page of Hacker News and received a lot of [interesting comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8159010)!
