> It’s important to note that that I don’t particularly care about the outward perception of the above Github chart. I think that’s the most important take away from this experiment: this is about a change that you’re making in your life for yourself not a change that you’re making to satisfy someone else’s perception of your work. The same goes for any form of dieting or exercise: if you don’t care about improving yourself then you’ll never actually succeed. - John Resig

Its inspiring to read about how programming greats like [John Resig](http://ejohn.org) are struggling with working on side projects and the changes they make to their lifestyle in order to push something meaningful each day.

I think no matter how experienced or productive one is as a programmer, each of us struggles with the same issues of feeling lazy, bored and occasionally too burnt out to code. What's motivated me most after the post is the fact that if John Resig can work this hard to write code each day so should I.

I'm currently on a 20 day streak github, which is the highest I've been on this far. Working on [newman](http://github.com/a85/newman) has been both fun and challenging to keep me engaged for 3 weeks. I'm quite anxious on how I will keep up the streak post the release but as John says, the important point is to make a change in yourself for something that you care about.

For those of you who haven't read the blog [post](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/), I'd strongly encourage you to do so!
